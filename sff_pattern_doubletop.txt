Inputs:
	LookbackBars(Numeric),
	Strength(Numeric),
	RangeFactor(Numeric);

Variables:
	RangeDelta(0.0),
	HighPivot(0.0),
	LowPivot(0.0),
	HighMinimum(7);

sff_pattern_doubletop = -1;
RangeDelta = RangeFactor * Volatility(LookbackBars);
HighPivot = PivotHighVSBar(1, High, Strength, Strength, LookbackBars);
LowPivot = PivotLowVSBar(1, Low, Strength, Strength, LookbackBars);

If HighPivot <> -1 and
LowPivot <> -1 and
HighPivot >= HighMinimum and
AbsValue(High - High[HighPivot]) <= RangeDelta and
AbsValue(High - Highest(High, HighPivot)) <= RangeDelta and
HighPivot > LowPivot Then
